## Introduction

Python is a versatile and powerful programming language widely used in various fields, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. This repository provides a day-by-day guide to learning Python, with each day's content building on the previous day.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you should have:
- A computer with internet access
- Basic understanding of programming concepts (optional but helpful)
- Motivation to learn and complete daily tasks

## Installation

To get started with Python, you'll need to install Python on your machine. Follow the instructions below based on your operating system.

### Windows

1. Download the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts. Ensure that you check the box that says "Add Python to PATH."

### macOS

1. Download the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Open the downloaded package and follow the instructions to install Python.

### Linux

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Run the following command to install Python:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python3
   ```

### Verify Installation

After installation, verify that Python is installed correctly by opening a terminal (or command prompt) and running:
```bash
python --version
```
or
```bash
python3 --version
```
You should see the installed version of Python.
